# First Grep

## Challenge
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in /problems/first-grep_5_452e1c1630eb14b6753e9a155c3ae588 on the shell server.

## Solution
```
grep 'picoCTF' file
```
`picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_887251c6}`
