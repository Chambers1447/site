# Insp3ct0r

## Challenge
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:63975

## Solution
It tells you that you need to inspect the site.  You are only given a third of the flag.  The website had 3 different parts, HTML, CSS, and JS. Once you've inspected all of them, you had all of the flags.
