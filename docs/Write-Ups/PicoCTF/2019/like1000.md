# like1000

## Challenge
This .tar file got tarred alot. Also available at /problems/like1000_0_369bbdba2af17750ddf10cc415672f1c.

## Solution
It looks like they're all `.tar` files, so I'm going to write a quick script to untar them.

```
#!/bin/bash

i=1000

while [ $i -ge 1 ]
do
        tar xf $i.tar
        rm $i.tar
        ((i--))
done
```
