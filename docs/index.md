## About Me

I deal mainly with offensive security.  I like to do CTFs and do random sysadmin things in my homelab.  In the process of getting spun up with traditional defensive security.

## About the Blog

This blog is here primarily to help me document and further solidify lessons learned, while hopefully benefiting others as well.

## Social

Social links are down below, but I'm not very active currently.  I do a lot of commits to GitHub, though. 

## CTFs and Write-Ups

I do my best to document my process.  If I have incomplete sections, I'm likely still working on it.  I'll finish it!

## Wiki

I also have a [wiki](https://wiki.dirwalk.com) that I try to update.  If you're looking for any additional information check it out!
