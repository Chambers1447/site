In an effort to make maintain my documentation and make it accessible, I've generated this Wiki.

This wiki consists tidbits of: 

* Penetration Testing and Offensive Security
* Defensive Security (hopefully soon)
* Systems Administration

Organizational structure and resources are likely to change, as I continue to organize and evaluate how I want information presented.

Enjoy!
